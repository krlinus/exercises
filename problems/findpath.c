 * Given a boolean 2D matrix (0-based index), find whether there is path from (0,0) to (x,y) and
 * if there is one path, print the minimum no of steps needed to reach it, else print -1 if the
 * destination is not reachable. You may move in only four direction ie up, down, left and right.
 * The path can only be created out of a cell if its value is 1.
