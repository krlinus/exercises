Laakmann Gayle "Cracking the coding interview"

1.1 Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has unique characters. What is you cannot use additional data structures?

1.2 Implement a function void reverse(char* str) which reverses a null terminated string

1.3 Given two strings write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other

1.4 Write a method to replace all spaces with %20. Assume the string has sufficient space at the end, and thatyou are given the "true" length of the string.
E.G: Input "Mr John Smith     ", 13
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"

1.5 Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string

1.6 Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

1.7 Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0

1.8 Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat")
