- Check prime
Input a number. If it is a prime, print YES else print NO

- Write a program that prints all prime numbers. (Note: if your programming language does not support arbitrary size numbers, printing all primes up to the largest number you can easily represent is fine too.)

- Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. I counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.

- Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.

- Search 101
For this problem, you must allow the user to enter exactly 5 numbers as initial input.
The program must then ask for an additional number.

The output of the program will indicate whether the last number is contained in the first 5 numbers.
Your output should resemble that provided in the example below.

All of the numbers that will be entered are integers.

Example 1

Enter a number: 1
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 15
Enter the number to be searched: 10

The number 10 appears in the first 5 numbers.

Example 2

Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 20
Enter a number: 30
Enter a number: 40
Enter a number: 50
Enter the number to be searched: 60

The number 60 does not appear in the first 5 numbers
