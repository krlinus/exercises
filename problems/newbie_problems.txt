- Search 101
For this problem, you must allow the user to enter exactly 5 numbers as initial input.
The program must then ask for an additional number.

The output of the program will indicate whether the last number is contained in the first 5 numbers.
Your output should resemble that provided in the example below.

All of the numbers that will be entered are integers.

Example 1

Enter a number: 1
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 15
Enter the number to be searched: 10

The number 10 appears in the first 5 numbers.

Example 2

Enter a number: 10
Enter a number: 20
Enter a number: 30
Enter a number: 40
Enter a number: 50
Enter the number to be searched: 60

The number 60 does not appear in the first 5 numbers

===============================================


- Binary to decimal converter
A binary number is a sequence of bits (binary digits – 0’s and 1’s) of the form
BnBn-1……B1 B0, where each Bi is a bit.

The decimal equivalent is calculated by Bn * 2n+ Bn-1 * 2n-1 + … + B1 * 2 + B0.

Write a program to input a binary number and output the decimal equivalent.

The sample input will not have more than 8 individual bits (i.e., the largest value to be entered is 11111111).

Example 1

Enter binary number: 101
In decimal: 5

Example 2

Enter binary number: 11111
In decimal: 31

===============================================


- Pushups with Blaze
At UAB football games, Blaze does push ups after each Blazer score. After the first Blazer touchdown (and point after), Blaze does 7 push ups. After the second touchdown and point after, the score is now 14 and Blaze does 14 push ups.

Write a program that calculates how many total push ups Blaze does during the whole game. Assume that only 7 point touchdowns (including the point after) occur. Prompt for the final score and print out how many push ups Blaze has done.

Example 1:
Enter final score: 21
Push ups: 42

Example 2:
Enter final score: 7
Push ups: 7

===============================================


- Valid identifier checker
An identifier in Java, C++ and most other programming languages must begin with a letter and then may be followed by any number of letters or digits.

It is possible that underscores (_) will also appear, but only in the middle and never two consecutively.

Write a program to read a string and output whether it is a valid or invalid identifier. Each string will be 10 characters or less in size.

Example 1:
Enter id: UAB_HSPC
Answer: UAB_HSPC is a valid identifier

Example 2:
Enter id: a_b_c__2
Answer: a_b_c__2 is not a valid identifier

===============================================

4) must not have space or slash (/)
5) at least one Capital letter
6) starting character must not be a number

- Do You Have Enough Money?

General Statement:
Read the amount of money you have and the prices of the items you intend to buy. Determine whether you have enough money to buy everything you selected or whether you are short of money. If you do not have enough money, indicate the amount of the shortfall. Be sure to include 8% tax when figuring the amount you need.

Input:
There are an unknown number of money amounts in the data set. The value –1 is used to indicate the end of the collection of prices. The first value is the money in the purse.

Output:
All letters are to be upper case. Include the amount of shortfall if you do not have enough money. This money amount is to have a dollar sign ($) in front of the amount and it is to be rounded to 2 decimal places. The output is to be formatted exactly like that for the sample output given below.

Assumptions:
The –1 used to indicate the end of a data collection is not part of the data for the problem.

Sample Input:
10.50 7.60 1.26 3.49 -1
Sample Output:
$2.84 SHORT

Sample Input:
15.75 6.00 3.98 -1
Sample Output:
ENOUGH MONEY

Sample Input:
21.00 5.25 5.75 4.76 3.98 1.50 -1
Sample Output:
$1.94 SHORT

===============================================


- Parallelogram Words

General Statement:
Output a given word horizontally and multiple times vertically so that each letter in the horizontal word matches the position of that letter vertically.

Input:
The first line in the data set is an integer that represents the number of words that follow. Each word is on a separate line.

Output:
The horizontal word is to be in the center of the output. Each vertical word is to read down from the top. The first vertical word uses the first letter of the horizontal word. The last vertical word uses the last letter of the horizontal word.

All outputs are to have the same left edge vertically.

The output is to be formatted exactly like that for the sample output given below.

Assumptions:
All letters are upper case. The maximum word length is 10.

Sample Input:
TEST
Sample output:
   T
  TE
 TES
TEST
EST
ST

Input: The first line of the data set for this problem is an integer that represents the number of words in the list. Each word is on a separate line

Output: The output is to be formatted exactly like that for the sample output given below.

Assumptions: All letters are upper case.

Sample Input:
4
REST
ACHE
