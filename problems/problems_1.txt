11. Hackerank cut the sticks - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/cut-the-sticks 
You are given sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.

Suppose we have six sticks of the following lengths:

5 4 4 2 2 8

Then, in one cut operation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the six sticks. For the next cut operation four sticks are left (of non-zero length), whose lengths are the following:

3 2 2 6

The above step is repeated until no sticks are left.

Given the length of sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations.

Note: For each cut operation, you have to recalcuate the length of smallest sticks (excluding zero-length sticks).

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer .
The next line contains integers: a0, a1,...aN-1 separated by space, where represents the length of the stick.

Output Format
For each operation, print the number of sticks that are cut, on separate lines.
