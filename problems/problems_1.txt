11. Hackerank cut the sticks - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/cut-the-sticks 
You are given sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such 
that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.

Suppose we have six sticks of the following lengths:

5 4 4 2 2 8

Then, in one cut operation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the six sticks. For the next cut operation four sticks are
left (of non-zero length), whose lengths are the following:

3 2 2 6

The above step is repeated until no sticks are left.

Given the length of sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations.

Note: For each cut operation, you have to recalcuate the length of smallest sticks (excluding zero-length sticks).

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer .
The next line contains integers: a0, a1,...aN-1 separated by space, where represents the length of the stick.

Output Format
For each operation, print the number of sticks that are cut, on separate lines.

13. Hackerrank challenge - angry-children
Given a list of integers, your task is to select integers from the list such that its unfairness is minimized.

if list L=(x1, x2, x3 .., xk) are K numbers selected from the list N, the unfairness is defined as
   max(L) - min(L)

where max denotes the largest integer among the elements of L, and min denotes the smallest integer among the elements of L.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer N.
The second line contains an integer K.
N lines follow. Each line contains an integer that belongs to the list N.

Note: Integers in the list N may not be unique.

Output Format
An integer that denotes the minimum possible value of unfairness.

Constraints
2 <= N <= 10^5
2 <= K <= N
0 <= integer in N <= 10^9


Sample Input #00

7
3
10
100
300
200
1000
20
30

Sample Output #00

20

Explanation #00
Here K=3; selecting the 3 integers such that L=(10,20,30), unfairness equals

max(10,20,30) - min(10,20,30) = 30 - 10 = 20

Sample Output #01

3

Explanation #01
Here K=4; selecting the 4 integers 1,2,3,4, unfairness equals

max(1,2,3,4) - min(1,2,3,4) = 4 - 1 = 3

Sample Input #02

6
3
10
20
30
100
101
102

Sample Output #02

2

Explanation #02

Here K=3; the 3 integers so that the difference between the maximum and the minimum is the smallest are (100,101,102), which
means unfairness equals

max(100, 101, 102) - min(100, 101, 102) = 102 - 100 = 2

Ans. See maxmin.py for solution
